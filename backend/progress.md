# Crisis-Cap Backend Development Progress
*Last Updated: January 27, 2025*

## Project Overview
Crisis-Cap is a crisis management platform designed for French firefighting services (Sapeurs-Pompiers), providing real-time coordination and resource management capabilities.

## Sprint 1 Progress (Foundation)

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration
- Initialized Node.js/Express project with TypeScript
- Configured MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence
- Set up development environment with proper TypeScript configuration
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system

### 2. Core Models Implementation
#### User Model
- Created comprehensive User model with role-based access control
- Implemented French firefighting hierarchy:
  - Sapeur-Pompier (Firefighter)
  - Team Leader (Chef d'Agr√®s)
  - Officer
  - Regional Coordinator
  - Logistics Manager

### 3. Authentication System
#### Middleware
- `authMiddleware.ts`: JWT verification and role-based access control
- `validateRequest.ts`: Request validation using Yup schemas

#### Validation Schemas
- `userSchema.ts`: 
  - Registration validation with strong password requirements
  - Login validation
  - User update validation

### 4. User Management System
#### Controllers
- `UserController.ts`: 
  - User registration with role-based access
  - Authentication (login)
  - Profile management
  - User search by role and station
  - Account activation/deactivation

#### Routes
- `userRoutes.ts`:
  - Public routes: login
  - Protected routes:
    - Profile management
    - User registration (Officer+ only)
    - User listing by role/station (Team Leader+)
    - User management (Officer+)

### 5. Security Features
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Request validation
- Error handling middleware

## Current Status
- Completed basic authentication and user management system
- Implemented role-based access control following French firefighting hierarchy
- Set up proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Established error handling patterns

## Next Steps
1. Implement remaining core services:
   - Intervention Management
   - Vehicle Tracking
   - Regional Operations
   - Resource Management
   - Transcription Service

2. Add real-time features:
   - WebSocket integration
   - Live status updates
   - Emergency alerts

3. Implement advanced features:
   - Weather integration
   - Location tracking
   - Resource optimization

## Technical Debt & Improvements
1. Add comprehensive testing
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Set up logging system
4. Add API documentation
5. Implement caching strategy

## Dependencies
- Express.js with TypeScript
- MongoDB/Mongoose
- JWT for authentication
- Yup for validation
- Socket.io (pending implementation)
- bcrypt for password hashing
