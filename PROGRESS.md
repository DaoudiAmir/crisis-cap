# Development Progress Log

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

### Week 1 (Current)
#### Completed
- [x] Initial project setup with TypeScript and Express
- [x] Basic authentication system with JWT
- [x] User management with role-based access
- [x] Basic API security with helmet and rate limiting

#### In Progress
- [ ] Database schema optimization
  - [ ] User model refinement
  - [ ] Station model implementation
  - [ ] Vehicle model implementation
  - [ ] Intervention model design
- [ ] Real-time communication setup with Socket.IO
  - [ ] WebSocket server configuration
  - [ ] Event handlers for real-time updates
  - [ ] Client connection management

#### Planned for Next Week
- API security hardening
  - Input validation
  - Request sanitization
  - Enhanced error handling
- Testing infrastructure setup
  - Unit test framework
  - Integration test setup
  - Test data generators

### Technical Debt & Improvements
1. Add comprehensive API documentation
2. Implement request validation middleware
3. Set up logging system
4. Configure continuous integration

## Next Phase Planning
### Phase 2: Firefighter & Team Leader Features
- Design database schemas for:
  - Interventions
  - Team assignments
  - Location tracking
  - Status updates
- Plan API endpoints for:
  - Intervention management
  - Team management
  - Real-time location updates

## Issues & Challenges
1. Need to optimize database queries for real-time updates
2. Planning scalable WebSocket implementation
3. Designing efficient data structures for location tracking

## Notes & Decisions
- Using MongoDB for flexibility in schema evolution
- Implementing WebSocket for real-time features
- Planning to use Redis for caching (future optimization)
- Will implement microservices architecture as system grows
